Buttons are a crucial part of the user interaction experience in Messenger bots. They allow users to take actions such as navigating to a webpage, triggering server events, or making phone calls. In the [`@pyyupsk/messenger-webhooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pyyupsk/messenger-webhooks) library, you can create three main types of buttons: URL buttons, Postback buttons, and Call buttons.

## Overview

This section covers the different types of buttons you can use in your bot messages, each serving a specific purpose. Below is a brief overview of each button type and their key features:
